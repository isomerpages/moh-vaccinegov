As of 12 May 2022, 92% of our total population have completed their primary vaccination series and 75% have received
their booster doses. With good vaccination coverage and the majority of our total population well-protected, we will be
progressively stepping down the number of Vaccination Centres (VCs) from end-May 2022, as previously announced on 22
April 2022.<br><br>
To ensure that COVID-19 testing and vaccination services remain accessible to the general public, we will be establishing a
first tranche of five Joint Testing &amp; Vaccination Centres (JTVCs) on 24 May 2022, with another five JTVCs opening
progressively across the island from end-June 2022. These centres are designed with the ability to scale up operations in the event of an emerging Variant of Concern in future.<br><br>
To enable the medical service providers to better manage vaccine preparation and reduce any unnecessary wastage, the
public are strongly encouraged to book an appointment at www.vaccine.gov.sg before proceeding to the JTVCs.

For COVID-19 testing services, please visit www.gowhere.gov.sg/testcentres. <br><br>

**Normal Operating Hours:**<br>
Monday - Friday: 9am-1pm, 2pm-7pm<br>
Sat and Eve of Public Holiday :9am-1pm<br>
Sun and gazetted Public Holidays: Close<br>
