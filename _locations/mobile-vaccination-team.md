 The mobile vaccination teams will be deployed at each location for a few days to a week, before moving to other locations, and returning to the original location to administer the second vaccination dose. This is to ensure that those who had receive the first dose will get their second dose at the same location.

 
 The deployment location and schedule of the mobile vaccination teams in are as follows:
 
 
| **Name** | **Address** | **Location** | **Date (For Dose 1)** | **Date of 2nd Dose (For Dose 2 only)** |
