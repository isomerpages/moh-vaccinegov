**Bivalent vaccines**<br>
The Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty bivalent vaccine for individuals aged 12 years and above is available at all vaccination locations offering the vaccine, including Polyclinics. The Moderna/Spikevax bivalent vaccine for individuals aged 18 years and above is available only at Joint Testing and Vaccination Centres (JTVC). If you wish to receive the Moderna/Spikevax bivalent vaccine, you may visit the nearest JTVC.

**For COVID-19 vaccination at the Polyclinics:**
*   Walk-ins to polyclinics are only accepted for persons aged 80 years and above.
*   For all other age groups, vaccination is by appointment which are made via the National Appointment System (NAS) which can be accessed via the SMS invitation.
*   Individuals may want to make appointments at JTVCs where more appointment slots may be available given the higher vaccination capacity.

**To book an appointment for paediatric vaccination:**<br>
* Refer to polyclinics indicated with “Moderna/Spikevax (6 months to 4 years)" or “Pfizer/Comirnaty Monovalent (5 to 11 years old)" vaccine type.<br>
* Polyclinics only accept appointments made via the NAS for now.<br>
* Parents/guardians who wish to vaccinate their child/ward at the selected polyclinics will have to register their child/ward at [child.vaccine.gov.sg](https://child.vaccine.gov.sg/). <br>
* An SMS with a personalised booking link will be sent to the registered mobile number of the parent/guardian within three to five working days. <br>
