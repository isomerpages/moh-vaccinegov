Please be informed that the vaccination booking system will be closed for upgrading from 1 July 2023

Children aged 6 months to 11 years may walk in with their parents/guardians to any of the Joint Testing and Vaccination Centres (JTVC) offering the vaccines recommended for the different age groups. On days where there is high **demand** for vaccination, individuals should expect a longer waiting period.
 
Under the National Vaccination Programme, children/wards below 18 years must have the consent of their parents/guardians to receive their vaccination. Those between the age of 13 to 17 years must bring a duly completed and signed hard or electronic copy of the parental consent form, which can be downloaded
[here](go.gov.sg/parcf). Those aged 12 and below must be accompanied by a parent/guardian. Parents/guardians should also bring along their child/ward's identification document (e.g. Birth Certificate and Health booklet/passport/student identification card/Singpass) for verification.

Individuals aged **12 years and above** may walk in to any JTVCs or polyclinics. Individuals who wish to receive their vaccination at the PHPCs are strongly encouraged to call the PHPC to avoid long waiting times.
