Children aged 6 months to 11 years may walk in with their parents/guardians to any Joint Testing and Vaccination Centre (JTVC) offering the vaccines recommended for the different age groups, without a prior appointment. On days where there is high demand for vaccination, individuals should expect a longer waiting period.
 
Alternatively, if a child/ward has not received any COVID-19 vaccine, parents/guardians can also register their child/ward at [child.vaccine.gov.sg](https://child.vaccine.gov.sg/). An SMS with a personalised booking link will be sent to the registered mobile number of the parent/guardian within three to five working days to book a vaccination appointment.

Under the National Vaccination Programme, children/wards below 18 years must have the consent of their parents/guardians to receive their vaccination. Those between the age of 13 to 17 years must bring a duly completed and signed hard or electronic copy of the parental consent form, which can be downloaded
[here](go.gov.sg/parcf). Those aged 12 and below must be accompanied by a parent/guardian. Parents/guardians should also bring along their child/ward's identification document (e.g. Birth Certificate and Health booklet/passport/student identification card/Singpass) for verification.

Individuals aged **12 years and above** may walk in to any JTVC, and seniors aged **80 years and above** may walk in to any JTVC, Polyclinic or PHPC. Individuals who wish to receive their vaccination at the polyclinics or PHPCs are strongly encouraged to make an appointment with the PHPC to avoid long waiting times.
