COVID-19 vaccination is free for all Singaporeans and long-term residents in Singapore.
As vaccine supply is currently limited, vaccinations will be rolled out in phases, starting with groups who are at greater risk and need the vaccine most.

**Phase 1** - Healthcare, frontline and essential workers <br/>
**Phase 2** - The vulnerable and those with high-risk medical conditions <br/>
**Phase 3** - The rest of the population

#### **Appointment slots are now open for healthcare, frontline workers and seniors.**

As part of a pilot launch, appointment slots are being progressively offered to seniors from 70 years old and above. Seniors will be notified by mail. Appointment slots are not open to the public currently. Please register your interest and we will notify you when you can make your appointments online.
