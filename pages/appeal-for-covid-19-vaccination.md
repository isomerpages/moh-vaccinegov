**COVID-19 vaccination for Short Term Pass Holders**

With effect from 18 August 2021, the vaccination programme will be open to short-term work pass and special pass holders, such as those on Training Employment Passes (TEPs), Training Work Permits (TWP), Work Holiday Passes (WHP) and Special Passes. It will also be made available to eligible Short-Term Visit Pass (STVP) holders who have been in Singapore for
at least 60 days. This will help reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19 even as we continue with our progressive re-opening. 

For avoidance of doubt:
