						<label class="tab-label" for="question-1-9">Why do we need to have a two-step
booking process?</label>
						<div class="tab-content">
							<p>
								As part of the two-step booking process, individuals must first (i) register their interest to be vaccinated at vaccine.gov.sg, and then (ii) receive a Short Message Service (SMS) invitation (within a few days) with a personalised booking link to book their vaccination appointments.
							</p>
							<p>
								This two-step process is necessary to ensure that we have verified the correct mobile number being used by the interested individuals to process their bookings, and more importantly, allow us to balance the demand for vaccination slots with our existing vaccine supplies. As more supplies arrive, we will progressively invite more individuals to book their appointments.

not advisable to do so.

someone who has completed 2 doses of <strong>PSAR-approved</strong> COVID-19 vaccine to get further vaccinated with another brand of COVID-19 vaccine.

								If you have previously taken a vaccine that is not approved under the National Vaccination Programme, you are advised to take 2 doses of the
approved ones.</p>

recommendations as follow-up data become
available from studies, if a booster is required
later on.
