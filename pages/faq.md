    					<p>All vaccines requiring 2 doses should be
completed using the same brand. There is no
data at this time to support switching vaccines
between dose 1 and dose 2, except for very
specific medical conditions, and it is therefore
not advisable to do so.

								There is no recommendation at this time for
someone who has completed 2 doses of <strong>PSAR-approved</strong> COVID-19 vaccine to get further vaccinated with another brand of COVID-19 vaccine.

								If you have previously taken a vaccine that is not approved under the National Vaccination Programme, you are advised to take 2 doses of the
approved ones.</p>
							<p>
								The Ministry of Health will provide
recommendations as follow-up data become
available from studies, if a booster is required
later on.
