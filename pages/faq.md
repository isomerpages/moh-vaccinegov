								For the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine, the second dose should be taken 8 weeks after the first dose, while the third dose should be taken 3 months after the second dose. Three doses of the Sinovac- CoronaVac COVID-19 vaccine are required to be considered fully vaccinated. Persons who had received three doses of COVID-19 vaccines as part of a primary vaccination series incorporating the Sinovac-Coronavac vaccine are recommended to receive a booster dose of either the mRNA or Novavax/Nuvaxovid vaccines. Such persons who received an mRNA vaccine as their third dose should do so around 5 months thereafter. However, those who received the
Sinovac-CoronaVac or Sinopharm vaccine as their third vaccine dose should do so at 3 months thereafter, due to lower antibody levels generated by the third vaccine dose.<br><br>
