						<input id="question-2-1" type="checkbox">
						<label for="question-2-1" class="tab-label">How many doses are there?</label>
						<div class="tab-content">
							<p>The dosing regimen for the primary series vaccination is 21 days apart for the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty vaccine, and 28 days apart for the Moderna/Spikevax vaccine. Two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty and Moderna/Spikevax COVID-19 vaccines are required to be fully vaccinated. A booster dose* is recommended to be taken <strong>from five months</strong> after you have been vaccinated with two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty or Moderna/Spikevax vaccines.<br><br>
								For the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine*, the second dose should be taken 28 days after the first dose, while the third dose should be taken 90 days after the second dose. Three doses of the Sinovac- CoronaVac COVID-19 vaccine are required to be considered fully vaccinated. Persons who had received three doses of COVID-19 vaccines as part of a primary vaccination series incorporating the Sinovac-Coronavac vaccine are recommended to receive a booster dose of either the Pfizer BioNTech/Comirnaty or Moderna mRNA vaccines. Such persons who received an mRNA vaccine as
their third dose should do so around 5 months thereafter. However, those who received the
Sinovac-CoronaVac or Sinopharm vaccine as their third vaccine dose should do so at 3 months
thereafter, due to lower antibody levels generated by the third vaccine dose.<br><br>
*Sinovac-CoronaVac should not be used as a booster vaccination. The exception is for persons who have been recommended to receive a booster but are unable to receive an mRNA vaccine due to medical reasons, such as an allergy to the mRNA vaccine.
