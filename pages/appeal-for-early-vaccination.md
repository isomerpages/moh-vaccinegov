### Request for Early COVID-19 Vaccination

All Singaporeans and long-term residents in Singapore will have the chance to be vaccinated by end-2021. In the meantime, we have received appeals from members of the public who wish to receive their vaccinations early for a variety of personal reasons, such as overseas travel. While our focus has been to vaccinate identified priority groups such as seniors, as more vaccine supplies arrive, we will begin to consider allowing appellants with very exceptional circumstances to receive early vaccination
