### Appeal for Early COVID-19 Vaccination

We will continue to systematically extend vaccination to other population segments from April onwards, so that all Singaporeans and long-term residents in Singapore will have the chance to be vaccinated by end-2021. In the meantime, we have received appeals from members of the public who wish to receive their vaccination early for a variety of personal reasons. While our focus has been to vaccinate identified priority groups, as more vaccine supplies arrive, we will begin to consider allowing appellants with very exceptional circumstances to receive early vaccination.

#### Please fill in this [Form](https://go.gov.sg/c19vacappeal) if you are requesting for early vaccination:

 Applications with no supporting documents attached will not be entertained. All other applications will be considered on an exceptional basis only.

We will prioritise applicants who are able to receive the full COVID-19 vaccination. Please note that for the current vaccines available, two doses are required three to four weeks apart, and require a further two weeks after the second dose to be fully effective. To provide sufficient lead time for processing and scheduling, you should submit your request at least **8 weeks** before departure from Singapore.


Submission of this form does not guarantee prioritisation for vaccination. Successful applicants will be notified by email. Re-appeals will not be entertained unless there are new grounds for consideration.
