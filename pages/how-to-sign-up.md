COVID-19 vaccination is free for all Singaporeans and long-term residents in Singapore.
As vaccine supply is currently limited, vaccinations will be rolled out in phases, starting with groups who are at greater risk and need the vaccine most.


COVID-19 vaccination for seniors will commence island-wide from 22 February. Over the next three weeks, seniors aged 70 years and above can expect to receive personalised letters inviting them to sign up for vaccination. Please wait for the invitation letter to book your appointment
