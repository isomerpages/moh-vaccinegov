COVID-19 vaccination is free for all Singaporeans and long-term residents in Singapore.
As vaccine supply is currently limited, vaccinations will be rolled out in phases, starting with groups who are at greater risk and need the vaccine most.
#### **Appointment slots are now open for healthcare, frontline workers and seniors.**

Appointment slots are being progressively offered to seniors from 70 years old and above. Seniors will be notified by mail. Appointment slots are not open to the public currently.
