COVID-19 vaccination is free for all Singaporeans and long-term residents in Singapore.
Due to limited vaccine supply, vaccinations will be rolled out in phases, starting with groups who are at greater risk and most in need of the vaccine.

**Phase 1** - Healthcare, front line and essential workers <br/>
**Phase 2** - The vulnerable and those with high-risk medical conditions <br/>
**Phase 3** - The third phase covers the rest of the population

#### **Appointment slots are now open for healthcare, frontline workers and selected seniors.**

As part of a pilot launch, appointment slots are being progressively rolled out to seniors between 70 and 80 years old. Selected seniors will be notified by mail. Vaccinations slots are not open to the public currently. Please preregister your interest and we will notify you when you can make appointments online.
