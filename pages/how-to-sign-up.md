For children aged 6 months to 11 years who have yet to receive any COVID-19 vaccine, parents/guardians will have to first register their child/ward at https://child.vaccine.gov.sg/ . An SMS with a personalised booking link will be sent to the registered mobile number of the parent/guardian within three to five working days to book a vaccination appointment via the National Appointment System. At the moment, vaccination for 6 months to 11 years old is only available at dedicated Vaccination Centres (VCs), selected Polyclinics and Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs).
 
Please visit https://www.gowhere.gov.sg/vaccine to locate the nearest VC, Polyclinic or PHPC offering vaccines for children aged 6 months to 4 years, and 5 to 11 years.

Individuals in other age groups may receive their vaccinations via the following means:
• Individuals aged 12 to 17 years may walk in to any Joint Testing and Vaccination Centre (JTVC) offering the
Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty vaccine.
• Individuals aged 18 years and above may walk in to any JTVC*.
• Seniors aged 60 years and above may walk in to any JTVC or participating PHPCs.

Individuals may also receive their vaccination at polyclinics and PHPCs. Vaccinations at polyclinics will only be offered on appointment basis, with the exception of seniors aged 80 years and above who may walk in for their vaccination. Individuals who wish to receive their vaccination at participating PHPCs are strongly encouraged to make an appointment with the PHPC to avoid long waiting times.

All vaccination sites, including clinics and polyclinics, currently only offer Monovalent Pfizer BioNTech/Comirnaty vaccines. Bivalent Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty vaccines will only be available at end of the year.

Under the National Vaccination Programme, children/wards below 18 years must have the consent of their parents/guardians to receive their vaccination. Those between the age of 13 to 17 years must bring a duly completed and signed hard or electronic copy of the parental consent form, which can be downloaded
here. Those aged 12 and below must be accompanied by a parent/guardian.

*Walk-ins for additional boosters are only applicable only for persons aged 50 years and above for now. Persons between the ages of 18 to 49 receiving their additional booster dose will have to book an appointment. Eligible individuals will receive an SMS invitation with a personalised booking link five months
after their last dose to book their additional booster dose appointment.
