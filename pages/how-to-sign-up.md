For children aged 6 months to 11 years who have yet to receive any COVID-19 vaccine, parents/guardians would need to register their child/ward at [child.vaccine.gov.sg](https://child.vaccine.gov.sg/). An SMS with a personalised booking link will be sent to the registered mobile number of the parent/guardian within three to five working days to book a vaccination appointment.

Children aged 6 months to 11 years may also walk in with their parents/guardians to any Vaccination Centre (VC), Joint Testing and Vaccination Centre (JTVC) Ang Mo Kio or JTVC Bukit Merah without a prior appointment. On days where there is high demand for vaccination, individuals should expect a longer waiting period.
 
Please visit [gowhere.gov.sg/vaccine](https://www.gowhere.gov.sg/vaccine) to locate the nearest vaccination site offering vaccines for children aged 6 months to 4 years, and 5 to 11 years.

Under the National Vaccination Programme, children/wards below 18 years must have the consent of their parents/guardians to receive their vaccination. Those between the age of 13 to 17 years must bring a duly completed and signed hard or electronic copy of the parental consent form, which can be downloaded
[here](go.gov.sg/parcf). Those aged 12 and below must be accompanied by a parent/guardian. Parents/guardians should also bring along their child/ward's identification document (e.g. Birth Certificate and Health booklet/passport/student identification card/Singpass) for verification.

Individuals in other age groups may receive their vaccinations via the following means:<br>
• Make an appointment at any JTVC, Polyclinic or participating Public Health Preparedness Clinic (PHPC) that offer the vaccine of choice using the link provided in the SMS invitation. Individuals who wish to receive their vaccination at participating PHPCs are strongly encouraged to make an appointment with the PHPC to avoid long waiting times.<br>
• Individuals aged 12 to 17 years may walk in to any JTVC offering the bivalent Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty vaccine.<br>
• Individuals aged 18 years and above may walk in to any JTVC to receive either the bivalent Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty vaccine or the bivalent Moderna/Spikevax vaccine. All JTVCs carry both vaccines.<br>
• Seniors aged 80 years and above may walk in to any JTVC, Polyclinic or PHPC.
